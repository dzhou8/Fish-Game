What impact do you want to have on the world and why?

The impact, or the difference between a world where I exist and a world where I don't, is the positive experiences of fun with those I interact.

It's not that I don't want the human race to succeed and expand to the cosmos. I'm definitely willing to help solve the problems of today. 

I would be extremely happy to be a doctor, because I would be able to see my patients and see all the lives I changed. It's awesome to do community and park volunteer work, because I can see the kids are happily swinging and climbing on the playground.

I wouldn't have fun being a banker or a businessman, that big bonus unable to fill my soul with richness. Just thinking about telemarketing scam calls gives me goosebumps.

I feel giddy when I finally complete a feature that is integral for the rest of my team. I'm proud of my little brother everytime he beats me in ping pong. And you can bet I congratulated my sister when she landed her dream job. 

After I'm dead, it will be no matter to me if Humanity reaches the stars or solves the mysteries of quarks. By then, the zeroes at the end of my bank account don't matter to me. What truly matters is the joy I provide others, and the satisfaction of seeing it come to life.
